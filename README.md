# Mini projects that im using to learn and problem solve (i guess)

When errors occur, i will be placing them here with an explanation for the prob and solution


# error 1:
4.25.22: attempting to learn to make webscrapers. bs4 and requests were getting error "reportMissingModuleSource". after some reading on many forums, i came across this: (https://exerror.com/import-flask-could-not-be-resolved-from-source-pylance/). it states to check your venv root. turns out vscode thinks i am in a venv when the venv was in a different directory so all installs went to other venv.
